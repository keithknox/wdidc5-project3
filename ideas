ideas for a project:
-------------------
1. a hotel booking page
2. a reservation to book a spot at the mall for a photo with santa/easter bunny
3. grocery delivery


went with an idea for an intinerary creator to check out vineyards in the Shenandoah Valley.
before I had my daughter, my wife and our friends loved to go camping in the Shenandoah Valley.  On the
way back, we'd stop at a vineyard and hang out for a few more hours.  For my wife's birthday one year, we did
a small vineyard tour of the region and I thought that it would be handy to be able to create an app that would help organize
a tour by the Yelp reviews and Google Maps.




user stories:
-------------


1. Users will be able to create an account
2. Users will be able to view the vineyards on a map and select by proximity
3. User will be able ot get a user review (from Yelp) and decide whether or not they'd like to visit
4. User will be able ot save their choice to a list
5. User will be able to view a copy of their itinerary (later to become an email)
